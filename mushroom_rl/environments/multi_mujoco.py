        Constructor.

        Args:
             file_names (list): The list of paths to the XML files to create the
                environments;
             actuation_spec (list): A list specifying the names of the joints
                which should be controllable by the agent. Can be left empty
                when all actuators should be used;
             observation_spec (list): A list containing the names of data that
                should be made available to the agent as an observation and
                their type (ObservationType). They are combined with a key,
                which is used to access the data. An entry in the list
                is given by: (key, name, type);
             gamma (float): The discounting factor of the environment;
             horizon (int): The maximum horizon for the environment;
             timestep (float): The timestep used by the MuJoCo
                simulator. If None, the default timestep specified in the XML will be used;
             n_substeps (int, 1): The number of substeps to use by the MuJoCo
                simulator. An action given by the agent will be applied for
                n_substeps before the agent receives the next observation and
                can act accordingly;
             n_intermediate_steps (int, 1): The number of steps between every action
                taken by the agent. Similar to n_substeps but allows the user
                to modify, control and access intermediate states.
             additional_data_spec (list, None): A list containing the data fields of
                interest, which should be read from or written to during
                simulation. The entries are given as the following tuples:
                (key, name, type) key is a string for later referencing in the
                "read_data" and "write_data" methods. The name is the name of
                the object in the XML specification and the type is the
                ObservationType;
             collision_groups (list, None): A list containing groups of geoms for
                which collisions should be checked during simulation via
                ``check_collision``. The entries are given as:
                ``(key, geom_names)``, where key is a string for later
                referencing in the "check_collision" method, and geom_names is
                a list of geom names in the XML specification.
             **viewer_params: other parameters to be passed to the viewer.
                See MujocoGlfwViewer documentation for the available options.
